                      <p>This accoustic is low cost for its high quality materials which include mahogany, rosewood, and a bone bridge.</p>

                      <p>This antique organ has a wide array of sounds. It is equipped with an orbit III synthesizer. This early synthesizer is limited in today's world but still has plenty of options to make unique and novel voices.</p>

                      <h2 class="instrument">Unknown Classical Accoustic Guitar</h2>
                      <div><img src="http://www.sprucetreemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/menkevichclass100clb.jpg"/></article></div></p>
                      <p>This guitar is equipped with nylon strings and is built in the classical style. While purchased for under $100, the quality and sound are of a mid-priced accoustic guitar. It bears no manufacturers marks, so its make is unknown. It is the only one of my instruments that was also a gift.</p>
